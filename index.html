<!-- To connect the above Dart file with an HTML file, you can create an HTML file and add a script tag to import the Dart file. Follow these steps:

1. Create an HTML file and save it with a suitable name, for example, index.html.

2. Inside the head section of the HTML file, add the following script tag to import the Dart file:

html Copy code
<script defer src="main.dart.js"></script>

Note that the defer attribute is used to ensure that the script is executed after the HTML has finished parsing.

3. Compile the Dart file to JavaScript using the following command:

dart compile js -O2 -o main.dart.js main.dart


Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the result.

Note that you need to run the dart compile js command every time you make changes to the Dart file to update the compiled JavaScript file. -->
